# LROC NAC Image
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Narrow-Angle Camera (LROC NAC) M146959973L 


???
This is a picture of moon surface, shot by Lunar Recon-nai-ssance Orbiter Camera with Narrow-Angel Camera. It is full of craters.

The number of craters on the surface or the crater intensity is meaningful for astrophysicists, they determine the relative ages of two celestial surfaces by comparing the crater numbers on their surfaces.

# Intro
Crater Counting<sup>[1-3]</sup>
- Determine celestial surface relative ages 
- Rely on analysts to mark craters 

???
Most of crater counting studies have relied on analysts to mark craters, like this picture, to record their locations and sizes on high-resolution photographs of the surfaces.  

--

Observation Error
- Individual differences between analysts 
- Inevitable observation error

???
In this case, Number of craters can vary from person to person, because of the individual biases about how they count the craters and also because of the differences of software and methods.

And even for a single analyst, there will be inâ€™evitable observation error, such as missing a real crater or adding a fake one.
--

Aim
- Estimate the real crater intensity/number on the area accounting for observation error

The goal in this study is to come up with a method to analyze a real crater dataset mapped by several analysts and estimate the real crater intensity accounting for the observation error

# Data

25,934 crater observations by 13 analysts on a LROC image of the moon surface

```{r eval=require('DT'), tidy=FALSE,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
da <- read.table("Crater_Meas_data.txt", header = T) 
dat = da %>% group_by(Observer) %>% slice(1:3)
DT::datatable(
  dat,
  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8)
)
```
???
The real crater dataset that motivates our work contains about 26, 000 crater observations marked by 13 analysts in the same region of a Lunar Recon-nai-ssance Orbiter Camera (LROC) image.

Each observation consists of the crater location, its diameter, the analyst name, and the camera type employed (WAC or NAC)

# Plot
```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet'), echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
rect = da[ da$X>700 & da$X<2300 & da$Y> -1800 & da$Y< -700, ]
leaflet(rect) %>%
  addRectangles(
    lng1=0, lat1=-5000/111000,
    lng2=3000/111000, lat2=500/111000,
    fillColor = "white", fillOpacity = 1,stroke = F
  ) %>% addCircles(~X/111000, ~Y/111000, ~Diameter/2, color="#03F", weight=1.5, fill = F) %>%
  setView(1500/111000,-1250/111000,zoom = 17)
```
???
This picture is a part of the original dataset, each circle represents a different observation identified by one analyst.

It shows us the inconsistency and overlapping among circles for each crater 
So, before the Bayesian analysis, I use a pretreatment process to remove those small variations from different observers for the same crater.

# Pretreatment
Hierarchical Clustering

- Dissimilarity  $$D=\dfrac{\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2+\color{red}\alpha(d_1-d_2)^2}}{\color{red}\min(d_1,d_2)}$$

- cut the cluster tree at an appropriate height<sup>*</sup> and average within cluster


.footnote[
[*] basic rule: the number of leaves in each branch below the cut $\le$ the total number of analysts
]

???
Alpha is a tuning parameter to adjust scaling between location and diameter differences. 

Taking the min of d1 and d2 is to magnify the difference between two circles with different sizes.
